# FastDiff
FastDiff(ractogram) is a small software toolkit for easy visualization and lightweight analysis of diffractograms. It has been made for X-Ray diffractograms, but can ofcourse also be used for diffractograms from other radiation types like neutrons.

Current features:

- Plotting of multiple diffractograms with possibility to zoom in on peaks
- Specific-Peak detection for lattice constant determination (so far only Platina data added)
